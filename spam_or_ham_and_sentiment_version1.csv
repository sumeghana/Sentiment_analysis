If you look at I-290 heading into downtown Chicago there is literally no room to expand the highway - each side has access roads and houses making expansion impossible. 
An elevated highway might be cheaper to build but would likely be more expensive to maintain - especially during the winter. Some kind of steam heating built underneath the road would be needed to stop snow accumulation.

"Understand this to all of you Elon Mush followers. EL ON, is an imposter on Our Planet and he is 
doing more harm to Our Planet and Atmosphere than you may think; with his revolutionary ideas. He is nothing but a South African Foreign Immigrant Boy Genius, that made his way into the USA through Canada, then by way of California. EL ON steals Our Tax Dollars by way of Grant Money from Our Own USA Government, which should go to USA Native Geniuses. No, instead Our Own USA Government gives this False Icon known as EL ON Musk the financial backing to pollute Our Earth with his Lithium Batteries and pollute Our Atmosphere with his Rockets and much other Space Debris. Now he plans to pollute Our Atmosphere even more with his Starlink Enterprise, which will cause a number of collisions with other Satellites in Space, causing more Space Junk and more Collisions. Who gave this EL ON a pass to pollute Our World and Atmosphere? The USA / State Government? News Flash, the Governments are there to Serve The People and We pay Our Taxes so the Governments can give EL ON more Grants and State Incentives to pollute Our World and Atmosphere.  This EL ON is an imposter sent to drain and deplete Our Planet and he is helping the Droconians find a new home in the next Planet over, Mars, so that they may Industrialize Mars too. Don't believe his hype. He only develops prototypes for his projects or Low Scale Developments of his ideas to a Minimum Point, so it is enough to get Investors and Grant Money. Or just to get Future Seekers, like me, following this Imposter. Our Future Generations are going to pay for the mess that EL ON has made here. By the way, if you think the ""Boring Company,"" is just another cute little name EL ON came up with; NO, the word ""Bor,"" means ""Drill,"" in the Dutch Language. That is exactly what the ""Boring Company,"" is doing; ""Drilling."" Under the Major Cities of the USA. There is something else going On here with EL ON. EL ON is from South Africa, but We All know the Dutch Settled in South Africa and created a Mass Apartiehd System, of Segregation, Hate, and Genocide on the Darker Peoples of South Africa.  The Dutch created one of the most Ruthless and Shameful Acts of Racism in Our Most Recent History. That same Dutch Mentality and Blood is in the Vessels of this Boy Genius, EL ON, that Everyone is praising today. The USA Government allows a Dutch / South African / Canadian / USA Alien Foreign Immigrant to come to Our Country and dig up under the streets in Our Major Cities in the name of getting from Point A to Point B faster, and he does his Ventures with USA Government Funding. What a Fu@kin joke. You People better wake up. EL ON is a master salesman and a golden boy for Future Seekers that want the latest gadgets for their garages. This is why he; sta, sta, sta, studders his words so much, because most of his words and prototypes will never come to fruition, and some are just lies. Last point: Why do I call him EL ON? Well, you know that all of the Biblical Arch Angels (Nephilims) have the EL on their last names (Micha'EL, Gabri'EL, Ari'EL, Isra'EL, etc.); and ON was an Ancient Demi-God of the Mesopotamian Era. EL ON is representing himself as this genius that We have started to worship as some sort of a Demi-God. I am kind of stuck on what to think about this EL ON now. I will keep track of his so-called progress and then make a determination.",spam,negative

"Doomed to failure, and the animation does not even closely resemble the sewer pipe they drove the Tesla in a couple months back.
The number of vehicles able to traverse this system is limited to the number of skates. The number of skates is limited to the number of parking spaces collectively used. When you enter the system you have rely on a skate being present. When you exit the system, you have to pray there is no skate in the stall you want to leave through. If you have more skates in the system than parking spaces, it is theoretically possible to have all the spaces occupied and nowhere available to exit the system.
Musk's vapid comments about being able to ""drill down indefinitely to create levels upon levels of tunnels"" should also clue most people in to the fact that he has NO clue. How does your skate get to the third level or 12th level of tunnels without encountering the others above it, how do you get from one level to the next, how do those tunnels converge at the terminus? How do you extract cars that wreck, catch fire (as Teslas do). And how are you expected to travel at hundreds of mph when your Tesla has no such top speed? In the LA sewer tunnel prototype, the heavily modified Tesla used its own motor to traverse the tunnel, and at a minimal top speed to boot. 300mph?  Pfft!
Let's say the skates actually were able to do 300mph. The car's suspension is not built for that. How is the skate going to attach itself to the vehicle? Wheel hubs, perhaps? Well, THEY'RE not built for that acceleration/deceleration either. And the safety features/airbags/crumple zones are ALSO not built to withstand accidents at 300mph. Also, whiplash much?

He is especially fond of fast-tracking, which illustrates his lack of wisdom.  There is absolutely no reason to construct the very restricted means of transport he is pushing.

"driving in nyc, whole new lanes (and roads) needed to deal with the 'elevator' spaces needed to get to the tunnels...
 which must be much deeper than subways even or you have tremendous structural problems with not only the weight of skyscrapers above, but subway tunnels, sewers piping, internet, gas, electric infrastructure, and people (not an unsubstantial weight, considering rush hour, buses, cars). Now build some elevators exactly matching up with street level going down to your boing tunnels, and those tunnels may not cause any higher structure to falter... and the elevators and lanes you want to co-opt can't cause traffic issues. this is still a pipe dream. the only way this can work is when a new city is expanding, and doesn't have the whole pop density/infrastructure density that la, chicago, ny has. they should be trying in this in smaller up and coming cities with higher elevation and nowhere near fault lines.",ham,neutral

 digging more deeply into the ground NEAR MAJOR FAULT LINES is a recipe for disaster... if you want to do this virginia or montana is a safe place to start, but there's no need there. california is one of the least safe places to do so. the problem with musk, is he's been continually fellated for such mediocre ideas he really believes the genius nonsense because he can get backers by wearing black and making outrageous claims onstage. its amazing people are so easily drawn in, when the 'genius' of jobs, gates, were so easily seen through. people need to start challenging musk with hard questions... or the whole bubble of his 'genius' is going to burst and leave a lot of creditors holding the bag. good ride while it lasted i guess though",spam,negative

"To everybody who is trying to ""debunk"" the project with the ""earthquake"" issue :D I did the research for your lazy arse, and I went on their website FAQ, and here is the answer: ""Tunnels, when designed properly, are known to be one of the safest places to be during an earthquake. From a structural safety standpoint, the tunnel moves uniformly with the ground, in contrast to surface structures.  Additionally, a large amount of earthquake damage occurs from falling debris, which does not apply inside tunnels. Some examples:
    1994 Northridge Earthquake: no damage to LA Subway tunnels
    1989 Loma Prieta (Northern California) Earthquake: no damage to tunnels, which were then used to transport rescue personnel
    1985 Mexico City Earthquake: no damage to tunnels, which were then used to transport rescue personnel""

For example, a Tesla owner enter a specified car port located on a map, then dock their car on the transport vehicle, and while the transport vehicle drives them on the highway from one port to another, it charges the Tesla at the same time! So its basically a mobile Supercharger... it would be similar to ""station hopping"" if we ever start interstellar space travel.* I would appreciate if Tesla gets me on board as I have extensive design ideas.

Just that they don't control their speed and turns.Futuristic Solution: Electric car enters tunnel, controls get overridden, car speed set to Xkm/hr.

There would just be too much engineering involved, and end up being very expensive and too extension too manage. If there were lots of areas (but not nearly as many that the parking spot sized elevator would require) basically just the size of a medium sized parking lot where cars can get in line and pull into a slot on a sled and then take off together, maybe 5 per sled, I think it could work better.

Who needs ""mass transit"" and those silly things called ""subways"", you can't take your car on one, so its so stupid an idea!Seems like every genius engineer has to have a Spruce Goose - it might work, but, in the long run, its expensive, and unnecessary, as well as an episode of time when they strip naked and store their pee in a jar, which would be Elon Musk's obsession with the ideas that something which we may never see for another 200 years, but he is *sure* we will have magically breakthroughs over, any day now (never mind that we don't even have a clue how the F to find those breakthroughs), will somehow pit uploaded/neuralinked transhumans against a malignant child of Siri (presumably without both being reduced to ineffectual idiocy by our poor understanding of sentience, consciousness and actual function of critical bits of the brain's function).Its all well and good to dwell on the grand ideas, and possible risks, of freaking science fiction, but not to the bloody stupid extent that you make the same mistake past writers did, and start thinking that, ""2020 sounds like a good date to pick for when it will all happen."", or the even bloody worse nonsense of assuming that, just because you can imagine something, the ""end result"" will ""look like, and function exactly like"", what you are imagining. Hint: it never does, and sometime, fear, lack of openness in the design process, etc. make it so that, even if it was vaguely ""possible"" to get a result, it will either be supplanted by something else, with its own limitations and problems, or it will never, ever, result in the exact form you imagined. What ever bits of the silly nonsense Musk keeps rambling about that do happen, they will look **nothing at all** like what he, or any of the other squirrely, semi-paranoid, ""visionaries"" imagine it will, unless, ironically, someone 50-100 years after the ""real one"" comes along decides to create a ""retro"" version. A sort of ""Fallout game"" equivalent of, ""What if we actually had all those crazy breakthroughs back in 2020, when the world looked so backwards and had so many silly idea?""Much of the stuff he comes up with, like every generation of ""visionaries"", is silly and absurd, even to the people living in it. Because, again... WTF good is it to take the existing problem, i.e., lack of public transportation, and/or sensible solutions to move people around, and shove all that into single vehicle, underground, and overly bloody complicated, ""single car transporters, which, when things f up, will leave you stuck down there, or misqueue and shove your car up under someone else on the road up top (or possibly open the hole in front of the car already there, or.. Good design means, ""Fewer things that can go wrong."", not, ""Heh, I think Rube Goldberg had a great solution to our traffic problem, here is how I would implement it!!"" Yikes! And the cost of doing it the stupid way, instead of just... firing all the idiots that keep stealing money from things like California's transit system (which would, sadly, be most of the politicians in the state), and actually building a light rail system for people... Mind, just to be clear on this - this is proof that Democrats, while they may be pro-social issues, are still conservative/greed driven on every other subject, and thus **not actually progressives**. The idiots in charge in other cities, including mine, which is conservative run, and in Arizona, pull the same thing, on the same issues. They recently killed public transportation (because, well, when no one, because of how the city is laid out, in part, can ""get"" to the damn bus, its kind of silly to whine about there being no one riding them), but, while they where still trying to fund it, they had a small.. hickup. Seems, millions went ""missing"", which where supposed to be allocated to the project. They, surprisingly, ""found"" enough millions, misallocated to other projects, to fix this, but ""never"" managed to work out how, whoops!, it went missing in the first place. I mean, seriously? When they can't f-ing keep track of where money went/got spent in **either** Republican or Democrat run cities/states, is it any wonder why both sides have some completely delusional ideas about how the economy works, with the former thinking that it all ""fixes itself, via market forces"", while the latter seems to think it just grows on trees?
Sorry about that bit of rant, but.. seriously, you can't, ""Do what is needed to elevate people above the problems they can't solve themselves."", by ""hoping"" the money will magically appear when needed, instead of.. actually planning out how to spend it sensibly (the Democrat's problem), nor by just going, ""Well, gosh... we have no idea where it went, but those people are not trying hard enough to fix their own problems anyway, so why worry? The market will fix everything, and I have this spendy project that will help the market coming up, so I need to cut something from children's food programs to pay for it!"" (the Republican solution). Where the F are the people, who we can vote for, that believe in a) actual accounting for the money, and b) actually making sure the freaking solutions ""fix"" the actual problems, instead of just wishing they fix themselves, or praying the money will drop out of the sky, to fund something they don't actually pay enough attention to for them to know if its working, or not, or why not?

How much will you be charged for the tunnel? At $5 (a ridiculously high toll) per car per entrance, it would take 85 million cars to pay off a single tunnel.

The initial price of tunnel is probably off, but the concept stays the same.

It looks to me as though this is intended for interstate travel. Look at the velocity figures presented in the animation. Very similar numbers to that of the bullet train in japan, which is primarily used to travel city to city over lengthy distances. I see a similar use here, a faster, safer, and more energy efficient alternative to interstate highways. It also has a leg up on air travel because once you arrive at your destination, you still have the comforts of your own vehicle to get around. In addition, it would be a great response to critics of Tesla vehicles who say that their range is an obstacle for travel over long distances because this could eliminate the need for constant refueling/recharging stops throughout the journey.

If this breaks down how is it not different from a highway?
Dumb ppl: Oh... I didn't think about all that... but I'm sure the scientist know what they are doing!
Smart ppl: Or Elon Musk owns a car company and doesn't want cars which are more profitable than mass transit to go away because all he cares about is making money and doesn't care the long term implications as long he makes a quick buck in the short term.

computer technology. The system in the video is going to require some 
kind of advanced supercomputer to handle merging, ingress and egress,

everyone has to drive to get to the tunnel entrances you're going to be 
stuck in traffic waiting to get in and out.If tunneling is orders of magnitude cheaper, suddenly there can 
be a subway line within walking distance of everything important in an 
urban core, and you don't need  a car for the last mile 
problem. From an urban planning perspective, a car-free or car-lite 
streetscape is much healthier for pedestrians, and in turn better for 
retail economies in the urban core.I forgot the most important part. MAINTENANCE COSTS. A more

"Looks like its a slightly larger version of the Tesla skateboard car base.  Four wheels with battery pack.  Way easier to make than a model S
 or even a model 3.  The lifts are generic leveraging mass production.  The main thing that makes it look impractical is the speed that suitable tunnels could be built.   But if they can nail that speed increase for tunnelling then... Yeah... Maybe.   Certainly less legal issues underground.  It could also be quite scalable and testable so long as you have a tunnelling machine and a team of ninjaneers.  Very crazy at first glance though.",spam,neutral
"It is unclear why the platform should drive the mesh, and not she herself, let's say, was driving on autopilot. It will take hundreds 
of thousands of platforms and charge them constantly. ",ham,neutral

Where is public massive transport there?,spam,neutral
"LOL.  Musk is a robot with robot ideas.  This looks great if you want to make the Earth's crust hollow,
 or are building a new metropolis from scratch.  Good luck bro.",spam,neutral
"Awesome concept. Revolutionary. Just don't use this technology in an earthquake prone area. 
And when will Elon come out with the personal tube transport demonstrated in Futurama?",ham,positive
YO DAWG I HEARD U LIKE CARS SO NOW U CAN PARK UR CAR IN A CAR SO YOU CAN DRIVE WHILE YOU DRIVE,spam,neutral
Curious what the business model would be? Do you need a subscription to enter the tunnel network? Toll booths?,spam,neutral

"This is quite ambitious.  I can see another country, like China doing this, because the US is too broken --
 we're broke revenue wise, and we're broke politically.  It would take decades and I'll be dead and gone if and when this happens.",spam,neutral
What about those subways? I mean how do you build those when there's a lot of subway tunnel existed in the city lol.,spam,neutral
"Why not completely discard the idea of personal vehicles and focus on public transport? I do not know other people, but I only have a car to move to places, not because I like to have it (in fact I would not have a car, it's a very expensive expense).

Simply set up an automated network of buses and cars that comes close to picking up people on request and taking them to their destination. It's not such a crazy idea if you think about it.

The automation of travel and communication between vehicles to improve traffic (at the level that traffic lights are no longer needed, for example, thus reducing travel time) is something that is already being done (and I think Tesla also works on something similar). After the success of services such as BlaBlaCar or Uber (leaving aside the nefarious news that the latter company raises) shows that society is prepared for it.

And by God, it will probably be so efficient that with 10% of the current traffic is enough to cover the displacement needs of the population.

Unfortunately I think that's the true science fiction. I very much doubt that the motoring lobbies are in favor of this. In fact this was already prevented at the time. Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy",spam,neutral

Who is going to pay for all this?,spam,neutral
"What happens when gang bangers start throwing people out of the cars at 130mph? Or when they throw 
garbage out? Suddenly the whole thing comes to a screeching halt, and we are stuck in traffic again, except that we are stuck fifty feet underground, with the nearest exit five miles away. Or how about when someone has a heart attack on this thing. How are emergency services going to get to them. What if there is a power failure. It is easy to make futuristic videos. Very easy.",ham,negative
Who is John Galt.......correction: Who is Elon Musk?,spam,neutral
"This is going to have to be dirt cheap for any city to act on it. It's a huge value add proposition: computers controlling traffic
, 125mph, no traffic accidents, no fumes from standard cars, new bus system. Lots to love, but tunnels, vehicle elevators, and human stupidity entering/exiting the elevator will be expensive!",spam,neutral

this is right from volcano island on the incredibles.   No idea if this would work but it is truly awesome!,spam,positive
"This really won't work at all. You'll just create more traffic as people wait for the elevators that can take one car at a time,

What's the point of putting the car on another vehicle if the car can drive by itself already?,ham,neutral
"Stupid as hell, I don't see how this will work at all. First of all, it looks like you have to wait a while to even get on a platform. 
Then, it doesn't even show a secure way to fasten the car to the cart. This video completely forgets about momentum and intertia. What happens if two carts crash? It looks like there is no AI on these mindless carts to compensate for extrenuous situations, they are just carts on underground rails. The amount of funding, equipment, and workers you would need for such an immense projects makes it not even worth it, especially if it still needs at least a decade to even happen. If you want faster traffic, invent flying cars or vehicles like star wars and invest in civilian flight paths....",ham,negative
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!,spam,positive
An interesting concept! Can't wait to see where this idea goes.,spam,positive
"lol America, your resistance to public transport has led to some really weird ideas. Why not just build high-speed trains underground?",spam,neutral
This is the epitome of inefficiency.,spam,negative
"This works for one car but when you have a pileup of cars trying to get in I don't see how this is faster than just
 building a ramp into a regular tunnel...",ham,neutral
"Musk, He crazy!

"Seems more efficient to just have normal roads leading underground and choose a few convenient entry and exit points around a city. 
All the elevators will cost the Earth to build and maintain, and I can just see how streets will get ruined by congestion caused by cars queuing for an elevator.",ham,neutral
Stupid idea.,spam,negative

"I don't think those platforms would be necessary for Tesla cars, or any other fully autonomous cars, because they already know how to drive themselves.
 I think those platforms would be necessary only for cars that don't have autopilot. And by the time this will become a reality... I don't think there's going to be a lot of cars without autopilot and the ability to communicate among each other.",ham,neutral
Then you'll create more traffic above with people  waiting for one of these fucking platforms to arrive... absolutely stupid,ham,negative

"That looks extremely expensive and I understand that you can't let people drive themselves in multi layered tunnels for security
